## ✨ Overview

The **ATM-BANK-INTERFACE-SYSTEM** is a desktop simulation of a simple banking infrastructure using Java. It includes:

- ATM interface for **withdrawals & balance checks**
- Bank interface for **account registration, deposits, and viewing account info**
- Integration with a **persistent data file (`data.txt`)** for storing customer data, ensuring data is saved across sessions.
- PIN & Card numbers are **securely randomly generated** during account registration.

Users can:
- **Register new accounts** with CNIC, Name, Initial Deposit.
- Receive **auto-generated unique PINs, Card numbers, and Account numbers.**
- Perform **deposits via Bank interface**.
- Use the **ATM interface to withdraw or check balances** by entering their PIN & Card.
